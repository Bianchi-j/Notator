# Notator
Notator is an application for taking notes outdoors with a smartphone or tablet, you can modify each value at any time then you can save the file on your smartphone in csv format. I created this application to optimize the value taking and the transfer of data to an external database. Before that I had to transcribe value by value, the data taken on paper. This project was programmed in C and is Android compatible .
